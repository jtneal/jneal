    Hello, my name is Jason Neal. Welcome to my home on the web!
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a web developer, software engineer, quality aficionado, solution architect, mentor, and more depending on who
    you ask. I'm located in Charlotte, NC, but originally from Greenville, SC. I find enjoyment working with a wide
    variety of technologies including Angular, TypeScript, Node, PHP, Docker, AWS, Linux, and many more.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-0">
    I consider myself a clean coder. I follow standards and style guides. I write clean, consistent, and secure code.
    I pride myself on maintaining 100% unit test code coverage across all of my projects. I am a professional that takes
    my career very seriously. I am an extremely passionate individual, and I believe it really shows through in my work.
